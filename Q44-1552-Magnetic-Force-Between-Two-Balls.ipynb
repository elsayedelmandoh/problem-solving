    "### Steps to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**\n",
    "   - We have `n` baskets, each at a distinct position.\n",
    "   - We need to place `m` balls into these baskets.\n",
    "   - The goal is to maximize the minimum magnetic force between any two balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constraints and Examples:**\n",
    "   - `2 <= n <= 10^5`\n",
    "   - `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`\n",
    "   - All positions are distinct.\n",
    "   - `2 <= m <= position.length`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plan:**\n",
    "   - **Sort the Positions:** The first step is to sort the array of basket positions.\n",
    "   - **Binary Search for the Maximum Minimum Force:** Use binary search to determine the largest possible minimum force between any two balls.\n",
    "   - **Check Feasibility:** For a given force, check if it's possible to place all `m` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least that force.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithm Details:**\n",
    "   - **Sorting:** Sort the positions to facilitate easy checking of distances.\n",
    "   - **Binary Search:**\n",
    "     - The lower bound (`left`) is `1` (minimum possible force).\n",
    "     - The upper bound (`right`) is `position[n-1] - position[0]` (maximum possible force).\n",
    "     - For each mid-point in the binary search, check if we can place all `m` balls with at least `mid` distance apart.\n",
    "   - **Feasibility Check:**\n",
    "     - Start placing the first ball in the first position.\n",
    "     - For each subsequent ball, place it in the next position that is at least `mid` distance away from the last placed ball.\n",
    "     - If you can place all `m` balls this way, then `mid` is feasible.\n"

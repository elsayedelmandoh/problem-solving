    "You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.\n",

    "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",

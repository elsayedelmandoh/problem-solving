    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m`, and an integer `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bloomDay[i]` represents the day on which the `i-th` flower will bloom.\n",
    "- To create a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.\n",
    "- You need to make `m` bouquets from the garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the minimum number of days required to be able to make `m` bouquets. If it's impossible to make `m` bouquets, return `-1`."

    "### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can utilize the binary search technique to efficiently determine the minimum number of days needed. Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check the Basic Feasibility**:\n",
    "   - First, check if the total number of flowers needed (`m * k`) is greater than the number of flowers available (`n`). If so, return `-1` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Setup**:\n",
    "   - Initialize two pointers: `left` starting at `1` (minimum possible day) and `right` starting at the maximum value in `bloomDay`.\n",
    "   - Use a while loop to continue searching until `left` equals `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binary Search Execution**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the middle day (`mid`) as `(left + right) // 2`.\n",
    "   - Implement a helper function `canMakeBouquets(mid)` to check if it's possible to make `m` bouquets using `k` adjacent flowers on day `mid`.\n",
    "   - If `canMakeBouquets(mid)` returns `True`, adjust `right` to `mid` to potentially find a smaller valid day.\n",
    "   - If `canMakeBouquets(mid)` returns `False`, adjust `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher days.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Helper Function `canMakeBouquets(mid)`**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the `bloomDay` array and count consecutive flowers that bloom on or before `mid`.\n",
    "   - Whenever you find `k` consecutive flowers that can be used to form a bouquet, increment a counter.\n",
    "   - If the counter reaches `m` during the iteration, return `True`.\n",
    "   - If you finish iterating and haven't formed `m` bouquets, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - After exiting the binary search loop, return `left`, which represents the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets."

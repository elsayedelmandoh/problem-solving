    "### Explanation of the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `jobs` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difficulty and profit of a job, sorted by difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `worker` is sorted to facilitate assigning the best possible job for each worker in a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Pointers**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `j` is a pointer that tracks the current job we are considering for the worker.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `max_profit` keeps track of the highest profit of jobs that the current worker can complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Greedy Assignment**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For each worker, while the worker's ability is greater than or equal to the job's difficulty, update `max_profit` with the highest profit seen so far.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Add the `max_profit` to `total_profit` for each worker."
